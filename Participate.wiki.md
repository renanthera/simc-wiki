# Introduction
The SimulationCraft team is comprised of volunteer developers from all over the world. We are always looking for new contributors.

We are a very laid back group of developers. While certain project members have areas of expertise, there is little in the way of strict responsibility and ownership. Developers are expected to exercise their initiative and help out wherever needed. The Google Code site provides considerable utilities for oversight. The mantra is: Just check it in. Don't ask for permission. If the code needs to be changed for functional (or artistic!) reasons, senior developers might revert/modify as needed.


# Participate
## How can I join the Team?
If you are interested in joining the team, please join us at our IRC channel at: irc.stratics.com (#simulationcraft) or send an email to natehieter@gmail.com with your contact info. We look forward to working with you!

## Where can I help?
SimulationCraft is built in a modular way, which allows developers specifically to work eg. on their own class. Besides class/game model development, there are various other areas where one can help.
