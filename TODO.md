# Introduction

This page details various features that are either missing from the sim, that would be nice to have, or outright required for certain things. They are in no order of importance.

# TODO
## Generic features
  * Combat phasing
    * Phase specific statistics

## Raid events
  * Concept of roles for raid effects (e.g., affects tank/healer/ranged dps/melee dps and so on)
  * Improved add support.

## Classes
  * Update for tanking support (all tanks)
  * Update for healing support (all healers)

# Nice to Have
  * GUI Paperdoll
  * World of Warcraft client combat log export
  * Buff Reaction Times: Make reaction times dependent on the observer, not on the buff source.
  * Allow scaling of all stats when explicitly specified
    * Expect to be able to calculate Scale Factor for X, even if X isn't calculated by default by calculate\_scale\_factors=1
