Warrior specific options:

into_the_fray_friends
  - Default value: 0
  - This tells the sim how many friends you will have within 10 yards of you, which will increase the amount of haste that you get from the talent.
  - Could be helpful for finding breakpoints of when the talent should be used.
  - Takes enemies into account on top of it, so if you set it to 1 and run patchwerk simulations, it will grant you 2 stacks from the haste buff. 

warrior_fixed_time
  - Default Value: 1
  - This is enabled by default so that <20% bosses live longer in a simulation with only warriors. 

non_dps_mechanics
  - Default value: 0
  - Enabling this will enable non dps stuff like healing from bloodthirst.
