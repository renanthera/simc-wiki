# Textual configuration interface
_This section is a part of the [TCI](TextualConfigurationInterface.md) reference._

Regular spells are not mentioned here, you just have to follow the standard [names formatting rules](TextualConfigurationInterface#Names_formatting.md).

  * eclipse\_max - Time until the next solar or lunar max.
  * eclipse\_change - Time until eclipse energy hits 0
  * eclipse\_energy - Balance bar position, ranges from -100(solar) to 100(lunar)
  * eclipse\_dir.lunar - Returns true if the balance bar is currently going towards Lunar
  * eclipse\_dir.solar - Returns true if the balance bar is currently going towards Solar.
  * lunar\_max  - Time until the next lunar max is reached
  * solar\_max  - Time until the next solar max is reached

```
Examples:
action+=/stellar_flare,if=eclipse_change<3
# Use stellar flare if within 3 seconds of 0 balance.

action+=/starsurge,if=charges=3
# Use starsurge if 3 charges are available.

action+=/moonfire,if=eclipse_max=0
#Use moonfire if eclipse is at lunar maximum. Moonfire will not work in solar unless celestial alignment is up.

action+=/stellar_flare,if=@eclipse<10&!dot.stellar_flare.ticking
#Use stellar flare if eclipse is within 10 of 0, and the dot is currently not ticking.  
#@ is the symbol for absolute value.

```
## Using shred to extend rip
> The _extend\_rip_ built-in condition for the _shred_ action will restrict the use of this action to circumstances where it will cause the extension of the duration of rip (i.e.: only when you have the shred glyph equipped and you did not reach the cap yet and rip is still ticking).
```
 # Only use shred if it will cause to extend rip
 actions+=/shred,extend_rip=1
```

## Buffs
> Regular buffs for this class are not mentioned here, you just have to follow the standard [names formatting rules](TextualConfigurationInterface#Names_formatting.md). Also, don't forget that set bonuses are added as buffs to a character. Buffs can be used in conditional expressions for actions, see [ActionLists#Buffs\_and\_debuffs](ActionLists#Buffs_and_debuffs.md).

  * combo\_points: the number of stacks is the current number of combo points you have.
