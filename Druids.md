## APL expressions

* **`ap_check.<allowed overcap = 0>`** Returns false if the action Astral Power + (if enabled) Nature's Balance passive Astral Power over execute time + (if enabled) Shooting Stars 1 proc Astral Power is higher than the maximum Astral Power. True otherwise.

* **`<action>.ap_check.<allowed overcap = 0>`** Same as above with the distinction that the action is specified.

## Options

* **initial_astral_power** (default: 8) Set the amount of astral power at start of combat. APLs are limited to a single pre-cast spell, thus the normal precasting of 2x solar wrath is simulated by the default setting of 8 + single pre-cast solar wrath. When having talented Nature's Balance this is set to 58 to account for the increased starting astral power.

* **lively_spirit_stacks** (default: 9) Set the number of stacks of the Lively Spirit azerite trait when you innervate a healer.

* **catweave_bear** (default: 0) Set `catweave_bear=1` to utilize the catweaving APL for Guardian Druids.
