## Options

* **initial_astral_power** (default: 8) Set the amount of astral power at start of combat. APLs are limited to a single pre-cast spell, thus the normal precasting of 2x solar wrath is simulated by the default setting of 8 + single pre-cast solar wrath.

* **lively_spirit_stacks** (default: 9) Set the number of stacks of the Lively Spirit azerite trait when you innervate a healer.
