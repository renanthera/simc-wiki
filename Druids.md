## APL expressions

* **`ap_check.<allowed overcap = 0>`** Returns false if the action Astral Power + (if enabled) Nature's Balance passive Astral Power over execute time + (if enabled) Shooting Stars 1 proc Astral Power is higher than the maximum Astral Power + allowed overcap (optional). True otherwise.

* **`<action>.ap_check.<allowed overcap = 0>`** Same as above with the distinction that the action is specified.

## Options
* **affinity_resources** (default: false) When set true, enables resources used specifically by your affinity talent, such as Energy with Feral Affinity.

* **initial_astral_power** (default: 0) Set the amount of astral power at start of combat. APLs are limited to a single pre-cast spell, thus the normal precasting of 2x solar wrath is simulated by the default setting of 8 + single pre-cast solar wrath. When having talented Nature's Balance this is set to 58 to account for the increased starting astral power.

* **initial_moon_stage** (default: 0) Set the starting state of the New Moon talent. 0: New Moon, 1: Half Moon, 2: Full Moon

* **kindred_spirits_partner_dps** (default: 1.0) Applies the multiplier to your own damage when determining how much damage your bonded partner does when you bond to a DPS partner with Kindred Spirits. For example, setting the value to 2.0 will mean that you are bonding to someone who does twice as much damage as you.
