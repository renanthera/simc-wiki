### Pantheon trinket system

The empowered pantheon trigger system is modelled as a combination of proxy users based on user input and the items carried by actors defined in the simulation profile. Each "proxy user" represents another actor in the environment who owns the type of trinket specified and attempts to proc it. Internally, each proxy user is represented by a discrete real-ppm object to simulate the proxy user attempting to proc their representative trinket throughout combat.

The current ruleset of the pantheon empowerment system (as of 2017-11-14) is as follows:
1) Require a combination of at least 4 active base trinket buffs
2) Treat Aman'Thul's Vision as a "wildcard buff", allowing each to count for 1.
3) Treat any number of Aggramar's Conviction, Golganneth's Vitality, Eonar's Compassion,
   Khazgoroth's Courage, and Norgannon's Prowess as a single buff; one buff of the given type
   will satisfy (a single) buff for the empowerment state check
4) Once at least 4 base trinket buffs are up, trigger empowerment on all real actors who have
   buffs up. Note that this can result in more than 4 empowerment buffs to trigger (if multiples
   of the trinkets in 3. are up currently)

#### Options

There are several sim-scope options that control the behaviour of the system.

 * **legion.pantheon_trinket_interval** (scope: global; default: 1) Sets the interval between attempts to proc the proxied pantheon base trinket buffs.
 * **legion.pantheon_trinket_interval_stddev** (scope: global; default: 0; range: 0..1) Sets the percentage amount of standard deviation from the mean in terms of **legion.pantheon_trinket_interval**.
 * **legion.pantheon_trinket_users** (scope: global) Creates proxy pantheon trinket users to the simulation environment. The format of the option is a '/'-delimited set of tokens of the form: `<type>:<haste%>`, where `<type>` is one of 'am', 'go', 'kh', 'eo', 'no', 'ag', for Aman'Thul's Vision, Golganneth's Vitality, Khaz'goroth's Courage, Eonar's Compassion, Norgannon's Prowess, and Aggramar's Conviction, respectively. The `<haste%>` value is the paperdoll haste value of the proxy caster. Multiple values of the same trinket type can be defined (also with different haste% values). _Note that some of the trinkets do not scale with haste. The system will automatically ignore haste% values given for such trinkets (based on client data)._
