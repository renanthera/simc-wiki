simc_gui.simc
==============

Introduction
-------------
The *simc_gui.simc* file contains **all** settings of the last simulation performed by the SimulationCraft GUI, including all options selected, overrides and the profiles simulated.

It serves as a documentation of the input used for the simulation, which can then be replicated with the command line client (CLI). Even more important, it can help to replicate errors/bugs encountered by users if they share the *simc_gui.simc* file with developers in a bug report.
