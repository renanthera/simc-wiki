# Textual configuration interface
_This section is a part of the [TCI](TextualConfigurationInterface) reference._

Regular spells are not mentioned here, you just have to follow the standard [names formatting rules](TextualConfigurationInterface#Names_formatting).

## Synchronizing weapons
The _sync\_weaapons_ (default: 0) option on the _auto\_attack_ action can be used to force the synchronization of weapons at the beginning of the fight. When zero, the offhand will be desynchronized by half of its swing time. In game, you always start with your weapons synchronized but target switching and parry rushes often lead you to go unsynchronized.
```
 # Ensure the player will start with synched weapons.
 actions+=/auto_attack,sync_weapons=1
```

## Stormlash

The Enhancement Shaman Stormlash ability is modeled on the shaman itself. It will not randomly select targets in multi-actor simulators. An additional player scope option `stormlash_targets` has been added to limit the maximum number of targets allowed to be affected by Stormlash. By default the option is set to 17, simulating a large raid.

## Buffs
Regular buffs for this class are not mentioned here, you just have to follow the standard [names formatting rules](TextualConfigurationInterface#Names_formatting.md). Also, don't forget that set bonuses are added as buffs to a character. Buffs can be used in conditional expressions for actions, see [ActionLists#Buffs\_and\_debuffs](ActionLists#Buffs_and_debuffs).
